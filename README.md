# DataAnalysisWithPython_Project

--Project Title
Developing a model to analyze the factors influencing customers' purchase intention and predicting their purchase intention

--Main objective
Apply Machine Learning in predicting online purchasing intention of customers based on 18 features collected from an e-commerce website. The dataset was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

--Process
1. The team trained and tested four algorithms: Naive Bayes, K-nearest neighbor, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
2. Then, the team evaluated the effectiveness of each algorithm and identified the best one for predicting purchasing intention.
3. Based on the analyzed data, the team determined the key factors that contribute the most to predicting the shopping behavior of customers.
4. Lastly, the team proposed some ways to attract more customers and improve the performance of the e-commerce website in terms of helping customers make purchase decisions.
